# This is a set of tools to monitor natural gas leaks and repairs in Massachusetts.

----
## What are you doing?
We're mapping natural gas utility company repairs and leaks in the state of Massachusetts. If your state/municipality/country also requires utility companies to report their leaks and repairs, you can do this to.

## Why are you doing it?
Between 2014 and 2015, a suspiciously large number of leaks disappeared from the public record without repairs having been recorded anywhere nearby. Unrepaired natural gas leaks are dangerous. We would like to see our infrastructure fixed, and less methane lost into our air.

Please make sure to keep the requirements.txt file up to date, and keep the existing folder structure in place, or at least consistent across years. If you need to move files around, use `git mv`, so that it doesn't look that moved files were deleted and then added.
