This folder contains records of leaks and repairs from Massachusetts utility companies in 2016. Because the data is released yearly, it is data _from_ 2016, but released in _2017_.

Filenames are structured as follows:
YYYY_UTILITY_NAME[(SUB_COMPANY)]_leaks/repairs.csv

The 2016_raw_files_from_HEETMA are what we received from the [HEETMA](http://www.heetma.org/) nonprofit. They get the data from the [Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities](http://www.mass.gov/eea/grants-and-tech-assistance/guidance-technical-assistance/agencies-and-divisions/dpu/), and do some manual cleanup of the PDF's, CSV's, etc.
